# Linting
 

Teams should follow the linting rules decided for the language in which they work. In addition to those language-specific rules, all teams should also adopt the following rules and enforce them in CI.

- [TODOs](#todos)

## TODOs
The use of TODO comments is allowed, but only if that comment has an issue number that corresponds to your team's tickiting system.

**Passes Linting:**
```
// TODO: [#2345] This uses a slow API. When the new API is finished, switch to that.
```

**Fails Linting:**
```
// TODO: This uses a slow API. When the new API is finished, switch to that.
```
