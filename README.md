## Goals of this Guide

### Have a Standard:
This outlines how we do things at Fynish. It is a work-in-progress, and may evolve over time as our own views on best practices change.

It's far more important that we have one, agreed upon way to do things than for us to figure out the perfect way. The guide is not perfect, but it is hopefully good enough to free us up to spend our time writing code - not arguing about semicolons or spacing.

### Minimize Context Switching:
There's always going to be a cost to team members switching between multiple languages, but there's no reason for us to also add arbitrary differences (i.e. single vs double quotes) when the languages themselves do not care. To this end, we are open to selecting style choices less popular with the language community at large, if it allows us to apply one consistent choice across all languages we use. 

### Help Newcomers:
The code base should be structure and written in a way such that new team members (or you looking at 6-month old code that you've now forgotten about) can easily grok.

### Encourage Stability/Maintainability:
Greenfield projects are always fun, but four years in people want to just ditch the existing code and switch to the latest framework to get rid of all the technical debt. We want to build projects that are still fun to work long after the MVP, and don't incur the high costs of constant rebuilds.
