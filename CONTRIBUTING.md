# Contributing

Nothing here is immutable. If we are wrong about something, submit a **well thought out, well written** PR explaining why a different choice better meets the goals we've outline for this guide. Links to blog posts or conference talks (including your own) are encouraged.

Anyone (inside or outside of Fynish) can submit PRs to this repo. However, know that we are going to be incredibly picky about anything getting merged here.
